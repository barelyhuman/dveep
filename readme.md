# dveep

> islands (_lang_: Hindi)

Straightforward node server that handles preact island rendering.

## What ?

`dveep` is an attempt to make it super simple to work with full stack
microservice styled components.

> **Note**: This is a more opinionated version of
> [prev](https://github.com/barelyhuman/prev) and while both share the same base
> plugins to be able to generate and render islands, this particular project is
> a lot more towards a more non hackable approach which a lot more people would
> prefer as compared to the DIY / Self Hack approach that prev is built upon.
